# Task-Management-Timer
Combining the timing of Pomodoro with Emergent Task Timer to make sure you manage your work in the most efficient way possible.

A friend of mine gave me the great idea to try and combine these two management techniques into a single system in order to best track projects and work flow. 

For those unaware, The Pomodoro technique was a system developed over 30 years ago that requires one to stop every 25 minutes in order to take a short (3-5 minute) break. After every 4 pomodoros, one would take a longer (15-30 minute) break. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

The Emergent Task Timer is a system that requires one to log their activities every interval (typically 15 minutes) for the sake of time analysis and pattern-spotting. Essentially a work diary. One writes what they intend to accomplish in the beginning of the day and then they are able to chart their path of progress and identify points of distraction.

Two great systems that could be combined with a linked timer which would allow one to take breaks and log their progress.
